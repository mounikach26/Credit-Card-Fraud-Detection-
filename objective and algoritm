Objective:
To design a Fraud Detection System for credit cards.

The daily handling of vast volumes of data and the requirement for models to be constructed rapidly enough to identify frauds in time present the key challenges in credit card fraud detection.


Algoritm Implementation:
For a binary classification problem, logistic regression's result is always between 0 and 1, which is appropriate. The likelihood that the current sample will be assigned to class=1 increases with increasing value, and vice versa. 
To implement the Logistic Regression using Python, we will use the same steps as we have done in previous topics of Regression. Below are the steps: 
1. Data Pre-processing step 
2. Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set 
3. Predicting the test result 
4. Test accuracy of the result(Creation of Confusion matrix) 
5. Visualizing the test set result.
